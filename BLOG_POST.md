# 🚀 Installing and Configuring MCPO for Open WebUI: A Complete Guide

*Published: August 22, 2025*

## 📝 Introduction

Today I successfully set up MCPO (MCP-to-OpenAPI) to work seamlessly with Open WebUI, providing access to powerful external APIs through the Model Context Protocol. This post documents the entire process, scripts, and configuration needed for a smooth installation.

## 🎯 What is MCPO?

MCPO is a bridge that converts Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers into OpenAPI endpoints, making them easily consumable by Open WebUI and other applications. It provides a standardized way to access external services like:

- **Exa AI** - Advanced web search and research
- **Perplexity** - AI-powered question answering  
- **Memory Systems** - Knowledge graph storage
- **Weather APIs** - Real-time weather data
- **Financial Data** - Stock prices and market information
- **And many more...**

## 🛠️ Installation Process

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Basic Linux command line knowledge
- API keys for the services you want to use

### Step 1: Get the Clean Installation Package

First, obtain the clean MCPO installation files from the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cfocoder/mcpo.git
cd mcpo
```

The package should include:

```
mcpo/
├── src/                           # Core Python source code
├── config.example.json            # Configuration template
├── config.working-example.json    # Working configuration example
├── .env.example                   # Environment variables template
├── .env.working-example           # Working environment example
├── docker-compose.yml             # Docker orchestration
├── Dockerfile                     # Container definition
├── mcpo.sh                        # Management script (the hero!)
├── pyproject.toml                 # Python dependencies
├── uv.lock                        # Locked dependency versions
├── README.md                      # Project documentation
├── INSTALL.md                     # Installation guide
└── LICENSE                        # License information
```

### Step 2: Initial Configuration

```bash
# Navigate to installation directory
cd /path/to/mcpo

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Add your API keys

# Set up MCP server configuration
cp config.example.json config.json
# Or use the working example:
cp config.working-example.json config.json
nano config.json  # Customize as needed
```

### Step 3: Configure API Keys

Edit your `.env` file to include required API keys:

```bash
# Essential API keys
EXA_API_KEY=your_exa_api_key_here
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_perplexity_api_key_here

# Optional additional keys
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_key
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_finance_key
```

### Step 4: Launch MCPO

The included `mcpo.sh` script makes management incredibly easy:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x mcpo.sh

# Start MCPO services
./mcpo.sh start

# Check if everything is running
./mcpo.sh status

# View logs to verify startup
./mcpo.sh logs
```

## 🎮 The Magic of mcpo.sh Script

The `mcpo.sh` script is a game-changer for managing the MCPO installation. Here are all the available commands:

### Management Commands

```bash
./mcpo.sh start          # Start all MCPO services
./mcpo.sh stop           # Stop all services gracefully  
./mcpo.sh restart        # Restart services (stop + start)
./mcpo.sh status         # Check running status
./mcpo.sh logs           # View recent logs
./mcpo.sh logs -f        # Follow logs in real-time
./mcpo.sh pull           # Update container images
./mcpo.sh build          # Rebuild containers from source
```

### Real-World Usage Examples

```bash
# Quick health check
./mcpo.sh status
# Output: ✅ MCPO is running (PID: 12345)

# Debug issues
./mcpo.sh logs | grep ERROR

# Update to latest version
./mcpo.sh stop
./mcpo.sh pull
./mcpo.sh start

# Monitor live activity
./mcpo.sh logs -f
```

## 🔗 Open WebUI Integration

### Adding MCPO APIs to Open WebUI

Once MCPO is running, integrate it with Open WebUI using these OpenAPI endpoints:

1. **Access Open WebUI Admin Panel**
   - Go to Settings → Functions
   - Click "Add Function"

2. **Add MCPO Functions**

   For each service, add the corresponding OpenAPI URL:

   ```
   Exa AI Research:
   http://localhost:8001/exa/openapi.json
   
   Perplexity Q&A:
   http://localhost:8001/perplexity/openapi.json
   
   Memory Management:
   http://localhost:8001/memory/openapi.json
   
   Weather Data:
   http://localhost:8001/weather/openapi.json
   
   Financial Data:
   http://localhost:8001/yahoo-finance/openapi.json
   ```

3. **Test Integration**
   - Create a new chat in Open WebUI
   - Try using the new functions:
     ```
     Search for recent AI research papers about transformers
     What's the weather in San Francisco?
     Get Apple stock price
     ```

### Tailscale Remote Access (Bonus!)

For secure remote access to MCPO, set up Tailscale serve:

```bash
# Configure Tailscale to serve MCPO
sudo tailscale serve --https=8443 --set-path=/mcpo http://localhost:8001

# Access remotely via:
https://your-hostname.your-tailnet.ts.net:8443/mcpo/docs
```

Then use the Tailscale URLs in Open WebUI:
```
https://your-hostname.your-tailnet.ts.net:8443/mcpo/exa/openapi.json
```

## 🚀 Real-World Configuration Example

Here's a working configuration that includes multiple useful services:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "exa": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-exa"],
      "env": {
        "EXA_API_KEY": "${EXA_API_KEY}"
      }
    },
    "perplexity": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "mcp-server-perplexity"],
      "env": {
        "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "${PERPLEXITY_API_KEY}"
      }
    },
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    },
    "weather": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "mcp-server-weather"],
      "env": {
        "OPENWEATHER_API_KEY": "${OPENWEATHER_API_KEY}"
      }
    },
    "yahoo-finance": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "mcp-server-yahoo-finance"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Problem: Container won't start**
```bash
./mcpo.sh logs
# Check for port conflicts or missing API keys
```

**Problem: API calls failing**
```bash
# Verify API keys are correctly set
cat .env | grep API_KEY

# Test individual endpoints
curl http://localhost:8001/health
curl http://localhost:8001/exa/openapi.json
```

**Problem: Open WebUI can't connect**
```bash
# Ensure MCPO is accessible
curl http://localhost:8001/docs

# Check if Docker port binding is correct
docker ps | grep mcpo
```

**Problem: Tailscale access issues**
```bash
# Verify Tailscale serve configuration
sudo tailscale serve status

# Check if service is bound to all interfaces (not just localhost)
```

### Verification Steps

1. **Check MCPO Status**: `./mcpo.sh status`
2. **Test API Health**: `curl http://localhost:8001/health`
3. **View Documentation**: Visit `http://localhost:8001/docs`
4. **Test Function Call**: Use Open WebUI to call a function
5. **Monitor Logs**: `./mcpo.sh logs -f` during testing

## 🎯 Pro Tips from Today's Experience

### 1. Always Use the Management Script
The `mcpo.sh` script saves enormous time. Instead of remembering Docker commands, just use:
```bash
./mcpo.sh status  # Instead of: docker ps | grep mcpo
./mcpo.sh logs    # Instead of: docker logs mcpo-container
```

### 2. Keep Working Examples
The installation includes `config.working-example.json` and `.env.working-example` files. These are invaluable for quickly restoring a known-good configuration.

### 3. Test Incrementally
Start with one or two MCP servers, verify they work in Open WebUI, then add more. This makes debugging much easier.

### 4. Monitor Logs During Integration
When adding functions to Open WebUI, keep `./mcpo.sh logs -f` running to see real-time API calls and catch issues immediately.

### 5. Use Health Endpoints
Always verify `http://localhost:8001/health` before troubleshooting complex issues.
